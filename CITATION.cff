abstract: >-
  Analysis of 1,500 years of historical climate records reveals a 215-year 
  periodicity in extreme climate events with remarkable precision (Â±5 years). 
  This pattern emerged empirically from data, not from theoretical imposition, 
  and predicts the next significant climate disruption in 2043-2044. The 
  deviations follow a 1,290-year sine wave modulation that explains varying 
  severity of events. Key evidence includes the 1479 Black Sea freeze occurring 
  exactly where the pattern predicts during the inter-cycle cold phase.
